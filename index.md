		<p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.

I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. </p>
